## 📖 Overview
The **EndHighUsageTasks** Windows Service is built using .NET Core 8 and is designed to monitor and manage system processes to prevent memory overutilization. It runs as a background service, periodically evaluating processes and taking actions to ensure system stability and resource efficiency.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **🖥️ Process Monitoring**: Tracks system processes and evaluates their memory usage against predefined thresholds.
- **⛔ Automatic Termination**: Stops processes exceeding the allowed memory limits and logs the event.
- **📧 Email Notifications**: Sends alerts to administrators when a process is terminated.
- **⚙️ Dynamic Configuration**: Reads configurations from `appsettings.json`, environment variables, and machine-specific settings, with caching for better performance.
- **🔁 Background Worker**: Executes tasks at regular intervals, with the duration configurable in the appsettings.
- **📂 Application Pool Management**: Identifies IIS application pools associated with process IDs for enhanced tracking.
- **📜 Robust Logging**: Uses Serilog for detailed logging, including errors, warnings, and informational messages.

## 🧩 Design Patterns Used

This project implements several design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and optimized performance:

### 💡 Dependency Injection
Used throughout the service to inject dependencies like `ILogger` and `IConfiguration` into constructors, promoting modularity and testability.

### 🔒 Singleton Pattern
Applied to services like `ReadConfigUtility` and `CommunicationService` to ensure a single instance exists during the application's lifecycle, reducing memory usage.

### 🏭 Factory Pattern
Used in the `Worker` class via `IServiceScopeFactory` to create scoped service instances dynamically for each task execution.

### 🖇️ Template Method Pattern
Implemented by extending the `BackgroundService` base class, allowing the `Worker` class to customize the logic while reusing the core lifecycle management.

### 🛠️ Builder Pattern
Used in `Program.cs` to configure the host and logger using fluent APIs, providing a clear and modular setup for services.

### 👀 Observer Pattern
Used with `ILogger` to capture log events. The logger observes and handles log messages without coupling tightly with the business logic.

### 🔌 Adapter Pattern
Implemented in classes like `CommunicationService` and `ReadConfigUtility` to adapt external dependencies (e.g., SMTP email, configuration) to the service's needs.

### 🗂️ Caching Pattern
Employed in `ReadConfigUtility` to cache frequently accessed configuration values, minimizing redundant reads and improving performance.

### 🎯 Strategy Pattern
Encapsulates email-sending logic in the `CommunicationService`, allowing easy extension or modification of communication methods without affecting other components.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Core Components
- **🔄 `Worker.cs`**: The background service that periodically runs tasks.
- **⚡ `TaskProcessManagerController.cs`**: Manages process monitoring and termination.
- **📬 `CommunicationService.cs`**: Handles email notifications.
- **📂 `ReadConfigUtility.cs`**: Reads configuration data and caches it for better performance.
- **🛠️ `Utility.cs`**: Provides helper methods for common tasks like file handling and JSON serialization.
- **📋 `TaskModel.cs`**: Represents the configuration for each task (process name and memory limit).
- **📧 `EmailSettings.cs`**: Stores SMTP settings for email communication.
